I'm a third year PHD student at H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm advised by Prof.Christos Alexopoulos and Prof.Edwin Romeijn. I received bachelor degree from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University (2018-2022). Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked with Prof.Yijie Peng (彭一杰) from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on pushing the frontier of inventory control and supply chain management by means of modern machine learning techniques. I investigate the application of deep reinforcement learning to complex (e.g., multi echelon network, nonlinear inventory dynamics, etc.) multi-period inventory control problems with real-life features.
